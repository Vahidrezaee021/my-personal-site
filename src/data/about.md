# About Me
I'm a software developer and IT specialist with a deep passion for building meaningful digital products. By day, I work full-time at a tech company. By night (and often in between), I’m growing my own startup and taking on freelance projects that challenge and inspire me.

With experience across both frontend and backend development, I specialize in JavaScript, PHP, and Python, and I have strong expertise in WordPress as well. Whether it’s crafting seamless user interfaces or designing scalable backend systems, I enjoy working across the stack to bring ideas to life.

Beyond code, I’m also active in the creative world. I write, make films, and direct theater productions whenever time allows. Storytelling—whether through art or software—has always been central to how I think and create. That said, technology remains my primary focus and the core of my professional journey.

One of my biggest dreams? Founding a leading tech company in the heart of Silicon Valley. (Yes, I know… that’s everyone’s dream—but still. Why not?)
